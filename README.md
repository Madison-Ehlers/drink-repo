 ## Rum
 #### Mai Tai - Favorite so far
  The rum quality here makes a big difference, so this one is a little more  For orange curacao, I recommend [Ferrand Dry Curacao](https://maisonferrand.com/en/content/pf-dry-curacao-1/).
 - **1oz** 8yr jamacian rum
 - **1oz** 8yr rum (non-jamacian)
 - **0.75oz** orange curaçao
 - **0.75-1oz** (depending on preference) freshly squeezed lime juice
 - **0.5oz** orgeat syrup

Mix all ingredients in a cocktail shaker with ice. Strain into a double whiskey glass, and top with crushed ice.

### Favorite Budget Mai Tai
This is one I found online, pretty standard and you can use basic ingredients for the rum and curacao. [Here is the original recipe.](https://www.liquor.com/recipes/traditional-mai-tai/)
- **1 1/2 oz** white rum
- **3/4 oz** orange curaçao
- **3/4 oz** lime juice, freshly squeezed
- **1/2 oz** orgeat
- **1/2 oz** dark rum

Mix all ingredients **besides** the dark rum in a cocktail shaker with crushed ice. Strain into a whiskey glass. Top the drink with the dark rum.
